# My NixOS configurations (Flake)

Here is my NixOS/home-manager configuration.

Some highlights:

* Multiple different type hosts (notebook, vps, servers)
* [flake.parts](https://flake.parts/) as a framework
* [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena/) for deploying configuration
* [ragenix](https://github.com/yaxitech/ragenix) for secret management
* Mesh network via [netbird](https://netbird.io/)
* WM is [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)

## Structure

My current flake structure:

* `nix` contains basic nix flake configuration like devShell, packages, applications, checks and so on:
** `checks` contains additional checks for pre-commit hook and `nix flake check`
** `control` manages `mission-control` configuration
** `formatter` configures treefmt parameters
** `shell` manages devShell configuration
** `lib` extends nixpkgs.lib with additional functions
* `nixos` contains a bunch of configurations for NixOS hosts
** `machines` contains folders with per host individual configurations like deploy, hardware and network.
** `modules` contains different modules for `NixOS` and `home-manager` 
** `overlays` is overlays for nixpkgs
** `roles` defines typical small suites used for the configuration of a `system` and `home-manager` modules
** `secrets` contains age encrypted secrets for hosts
** `users` manages a basic user configutaions
