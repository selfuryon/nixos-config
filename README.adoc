# My NixOS configurations

For configurations purposes I use these tools:

* NixOS as basic OS
* flakes for configuration
* deploy-rs for deploying configuration
* ragenix for secret management

## Configuration organization

My current configuration organization:

* `machines` consist of a different VPS/notebook specific configurations. Each configuration usually contains:
* `overlays` contains overlays used in configuration
* `secrets` contains age encrypted secrets
* `users` folder contains specific user configurations, and it also has some subfolders:
** `keys` determines ssh-keys per host (I use unique ssh keys per host)
** `roles` determines role definition for specific user, it also consist from small configurations called `suites`.
