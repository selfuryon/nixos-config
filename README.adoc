# My NixOS configurations

For configurations purposes I use these tools:

* NixOS as basic OS
* flakes for configuration
* deploy-rs for deploying configuration
* ragenix for secret management

## Configuration organization

My current configuration organization:

* `machines` consist of a different VPS/notebook specific configurations. Each configuration usually contains:
** `secrets` folder for different specific to this hots secrets like wireguard keys and so organization
** `config.nix` which determines inventory properties for this host such as name, system and deploy-rs configuration
* `overlays` contains overlays used in configuration
* `roles` folder determines a role for specific machine. Each roles consist from small configurations called `suites`.
* `users` folder contains specific user configurations, and it also has some subfolders:
** `keys` determines ssh-keys per host (I use unique ssh keys per host)
** `roles` determines role definition for specific user, it also consist from small configurations called `suites`.
